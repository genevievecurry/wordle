If you've played around with MidJourney, you might have noticed a pattern of racial bias in the art it generates. This isn't exactly surprising, as tools tend to reflect their creators, and the datasets/creative works they are using to train models are going to amplify stereotypes.

I put together some links if you're curious to read more about that:

## Biased Images

For this particular Wordle solution set, `DIVAS`, `PLANT`, and `PARTY`, MidJourney generated some fun images that absolutely hit the mark, but they all featured the same perfectly symmetrical, generically pretty white women. I tweaked the prompt a bit for the main image above, because I don't have to perpetuate the limitations of MidJourney on _my_ hobby website.

Here's some of the images MidJourney originally generated, so you can see what I mean:

Also, what's with all the sunglasses??

## Strange Artifacts

![A MidJourney generated image of a group of women having fun, sitting in a room full of plants.](775-1-up.jpg "Prompt: `a diverse group of divas, plant, party --v 5.2`")

And finally, this is one of the images that MidJourney generated for the prompt `a diverse group of divas, plant, party --v 5.2`. I suppose we could imagine that the woman in the center of the group is wearing white tights, but I think the real answer is that the model biffed it and transplanted the legs from the blond woman to her right.

Otherwise, it's a nice composition... but where are the sunglasses!?
