I think it's a pretty common strategy for Wordle solvers to pick a word they like and use it each day. When my partner was solving puzzles, `ALIEN` was his starter word.

I like to pick different words each day, partially in service to this goofy project, and also because the dopamine payoff of getting a Wordle puzzle correct on the first guess is potentially going to happen more than once ðŸ˜Œ... not that it's happened since I started Wordle Illustrated, by each day brings a new opportunity for greatness!

The image above more excellently represents the solution, `QUICK`, than the one below, but I felt it must be shared. Just bask in the glory of the chimp-adjacent creatures.
