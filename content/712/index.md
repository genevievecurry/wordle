This is my second-ever failed Wordle puzzle, and the first since I started doing this project!

It's somewhat arbitary, but I decided since I described this website as having Midjourney illustrate my _guesses_, that I wouldn't include the solution in the prompt.

The illustration is kind of `JAZZY` anyway, isn't it?
