title: "--stylize"

From [midjourney.com](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/stylize):

> The Midjourney Bot has been trained to produce images that favor artistic color, composition, and forms. The `--stylize` or `--s` parameter influences how strongly this training is applied. Low stylization values produce images that closely match the prompt but are less artistic. High stylization values create images that are very artistic but less connected to the prompt.
