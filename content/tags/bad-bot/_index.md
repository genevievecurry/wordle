title: "Bad Bot"

These are images that don't really illustrate my guesses. There might be a few reasons this happens:

- I guessed terrible, boring words. I never said I was good at this game.
- It generated images that matched the guesses but that were too generic, gross or sexist and I didn't want to post them, so I picked a generated image that I hated the least.
- The bot was having a bad day.

You can always look at posts tagged with [good-bot]({{< ref "/tags/good-bot" >}}), instead.
