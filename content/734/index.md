MidJourney released an updated model version for testing on June 22nd, but I didn't notice until a day later, and after I'd already settled on an image for this Wordle's guesses and solution.

I ran this prompt a few times with `--v 5.1` and `--v 5.2` (I usually include the specific model when I run a prompt so that I can keep track of what I'm doing, but it defaults to the newest one if you don't include a model).

From what I could see, `V5.1` favored tacos in space and dogs, whereas `V5.2` favored women surrounded by food.
