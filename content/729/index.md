After the images came in, I realized I had an image in my mind for what I was hoping MidJourney would deliver. It generated a bunch of images of anthropomorphic goldfish, which are charming in thier own way.

Just for fun, here's an image that I generated with my own prompt that was _partially_ successful. I suppose it might pay to learn to speak the language of the bot for moments like this, but it got close enough, right? Some of the images it generated included things that were vaguely bee-like, but this was the best.

> A clear honey jar sits below a shady tree. A shy bee peeks from behind the tree. Inside the honey jar is a goldfish.
