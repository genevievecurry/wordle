Admittedly, I ran this one through a few times.

Initially, I used the Niji model (trained on anime aesthetics), but the generated results lacked anything that strongly signalled the solution, "grief", to me. The lack of a useful noun in my guesses probably didn't help.

I went back to using their default model, which produced the image above, which at least causes me some grief (it's a little creepy).
