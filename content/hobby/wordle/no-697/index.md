I really liked the first four interpretations of the prompt, and was curious if running the prompt again would produce another set of interesting images. I think the second run was even better than the first.

Here are all eight images that were generated:

![Four AI interpretations of the 'magic, flaws, plane, plank' prompt.](697_4up_1.jpg "The initial four options.")

![Four more AI interpretations of the 'magic, flaws, plane, plank' prompt.](697_4up_2.jpg "The second set.")
