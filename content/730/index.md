This puzzle was a little rough on me. I share my "censored" wordle solutions with a group of friends on Discord, and one of them wrote about her puzzle solving experience: "This one made me feel like I went on a short walk that was twisty and turny but I got a treat at the end."

That experience sounded really nice as I flipped back to my unsolved puzzle, which felt more like moving a couch upstairs to a fifth-floor walk up.

I definitely got stuck on a landing for awhile, but managed to figure it out without sawing the couch in half (mostly because I ran out of letters).

This one was funny because the `KAZOO` is definitely coming out of his chin. Also, I am interpreting `THROB` as _heart throb_ here.

`CANON`, initially, I was like, sure, the `KAZOO` sort of looks like a cannon, but then I realized that this guess has one too few `N`s, and is not a projectile-firing weapon, but rather a noun with a more conceptual meaning. So... _maybe_...
