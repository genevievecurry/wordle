This is my very first Wordle guess sequence sent to the Midjourney bot as a prompt. After sending a prompt to the bot, it responds with four variations. After it resolves the images, we can select one to use as a seed for four more variations, or choose to upscale one of the options we've been given.

The husky collection above is actually the second attempt at a prompt. When I sent the first one, using their `5.1` model, I didn't use commas, and the result favored the solution, broom, over the other words in the sequence.
