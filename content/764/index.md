`WHALE` was my first guess for a [puzzle earlier this week]({{< ref "758" >}})!

I wonder if `WHALE` was in my head because I recently listened to a [podcast series on Freakonomics about the history of the whaling industry](https://freakonomics.com/podcast-tag/everything-you-never-knew-about-whaling/)?
